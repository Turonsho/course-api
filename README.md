Course Management System API
This is my RESTful API for managing students, courses, and enrollments. I wrote it in Go using gorilla/mux for routing. It handles CRUD operations for students and courses and manages student enrollments. Data is stored in memory.
How to Run the Project
Prerequisites

Go (v1.18 or higher)
curl or Postman for testing

Setup

Clone the repo:
git clone git@github.com:Turonsho/course-api.git
cd course-api


Install dependencies:
go mod tidy


Run the server:
go run main.go

The API runs at http://localhost:8080.


Notes

Data is in memory and resets on server restart.
I included sample data with a few students and courses.

Test endpoints with curl or Postman.
I handled errors for invalid inputs, non-existent students/courses, and duplicate enrollments.
Sample data loads on server start.

Notes

I used gorilla/mux for routing.
Data is in memory for simplicity. For production, Iâ€™d use a database.
I added validation for required fields and emails.
